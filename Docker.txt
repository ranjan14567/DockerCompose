Docker is a container management service. 
The keywords of Docker are develop, ship and run anywhere. 
The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

The initial release of Docker was in March 2013.
it has become the buzzword for modern world development, especially in the face of Agile-based projects.

Docker - Hub
Docker Hub is a registry service on the cloud that allows you to download Docker images that are built by other communities. 
You can also upload your own Docker built images to Docker hub. 
We can download the Jenkins Docker image from Docker hub.

Docker - Images
In Docker, everything is based on Images. An image is a combination of a file system and parameters.

$ docker run hello-world 

$ sudo docker run -it centos /bin/bash

sudo : it is a command to runs with root access
run : it is a command used to mention to create an instance of an image, which is called container.
-it : run in interactive mode
/bin/bash : run the bash shell once CentOS is up and running
centos : Name of the image we want to download from Docker Hub and install on your machine

$ docker images   //Display all images currently installed on the system.

Each Images have following attributes:
REPOSITORY VIRTUAL SIZE: Size of the images
TAG: Used to logically tag images
IMAGE ID: Used to uniquely identify the image
Created: The number of days since the image was created

$ docker run <image_name>
Images can be downloaded from Docker Hub using the Docker run command.
Image − This is the name of the image which is used to run the container.

Removing Docker Images:
The Docker images on the system can be removed via the docker rmi command.
$ docker rmi ImageID 

$ sudo docker images -q 
q − It tells the Docker command to return the Image ID’s only.

docker inspect:
This command is used see the details of an image or container.
Syntax
docker inspect <image_name>

Docker - Containers:
Containers are instances of Docker images that can be run using the Docker run command. 
The basic purpose of Docker is to run containers.

Running a Container:
Running of containers is managed with the Docker run command. 
To run a container in an interactive mode, first launch the Docker container.
$ sudo docker run –it centos /bin/bash 

Listing of Containers
This command is used to return the currently running containers.
$ docker ps

$ docker ps -a 
Options
─a : It tells the docker ps command to list all of the containers on the system.

docker history:
you can see all the commands that were run with an image via a container.
Syntax
$ docker history ImageID 

docker top:
You can see the top processes within a container.
Syntax
$ docker top ContainerID 

docker stop:
This command is used to stop a running container.
Syntax
docker stop ContainerID

docker rm:
This command is used to delete a container.
Syntax
$ docker rm ContainerID

docker stats:
This command is used to provide the statistics of a running container.
Syntax
docker stats ContainerID

docker attach:
This command is used to attach to a running container.
Syntax
$ docker attach ContainerID 

docker pause:
This command is used to pause the processes in a running container.
Syntax
$ docker pause ContainerID

docker unpause:
This command is used to unpause the processes in a running container.
Syntax
$ docker unpause ContainerID

docker kill
This command is used to kill the processes in a running container.
Syntax
$ docker kill ContainerID
